				<p class = "text">Cookie Collector 3DS was made in 2016 as a test of 3DS Homebrew Libraries. You can download the original <a href = "https://github.com/Kaisogen/CookieCollector-3DS-/releases">here</a>.</p>
			</main>

				<h1 class = "title">Alternatives</h1>
				<p>You can use the source as a way of learning a bit of C with the 3DS, but I would not play it. More features are being added by the day, so keep a look out! Alternatives to this game includes:</p>
				<pre>    Creckeryop's <a href = "https://github.com/Creckeryop/3dsCookieClicker/">Cookie Clicker</a></pre>
				<pre>    TheMachinumps' <a href ="https://github.com/TheMachinumps/Cookie_Clicker_3DS/">Cookie Clicker 3DS</a></pre>
				<pre>    TheMachinumps' <a href ="https://github.com/TheMachinumps/CookieCollector-3DS-/">Cookie Collector 3DS Fork</a></pre>
			</main>
			
			<main>
				<h1 class = "title">Usage</h1>
				<p>Grab a release file from the releases page, or compile the code yourself. Place the 3DSX and SDMH in /root/3DS/games/CookieCollector/</p>
				<p>Your files should look like this:</p>
				<pre>/root <br>    /3DS<br>            /games<br>            /CookieCollector<br>                CookieCollector.3DSX<br>                CookieCollector.SDMH</pre>
				<p>Run the CookieCollector.3DSX file in the Homebrew Launcher, from an entrypoint of your choice. Have fun.</p>
			</main>
			
			<main>
				<h1 class = "title">Compilation</h1>
				<p>Clone the repo, and unzip it somewhere. Make a new directory labelled 'source', and place 'main.c' in there. CD to the root of the repo, and run 'make'. Once it has finished, it will produce an ELF and a 3DSX file of the same name. Grab the SDMH from the releases page, and then use that instead of the generated one.</p>
				<p>This assumes you have installed the necessary libraries and DevkitPro.</p>

			<main>
				<h1 class = "title">SpriteTools Version (aka, the forgotten version that was never finished... maybe)</h1>
				<p>The game has a version being developed in Spritetools. It is far behind, as I do not know how to use Spritetools. The current release is a beta that does not function as intended. Feel free to report errors and solutions in the Issue tracker.</p>
				<br>
				<p>To access the latest Spritetools version, there will be separate releases for them. For the code, it is stored in a separate branch, labeled SpriteTools.</p>
